# CaesersCipher
Caesar cipher is used to transform text into unreadable text. It takes as input an alphabet (in certain order), an offset on that alphabet, and an input text. It produces a text where each character in the original text has been replaced with a character in the alphabet that is n positions to the right (n is the offset) in the alphabet (assume a circular alphabet).
